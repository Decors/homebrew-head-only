Homebrew-headonly
=================
These formulae are only available in head-only versions, and have no
stable tarballs.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap homebrew/headonly` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/headonly/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-headonly/master/<formula>.rb
```
